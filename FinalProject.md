## Overview 

Imagine a world where you can have a personal trainer, mental wellness coach, and health expert in the palm of your hand, guiding you every day toward achieving your fitness and life goals. Our app is not just about physical training - it is a holistic approach to health, success, and well-being. The problem that our application solves is that newcomers are unaware of gym activity and healthy practices. As such, we address this by educating people about the gym, and its purpose and guiding them through their training. 

The fitness industry is booming, but millions of people still struggle to reach their health and fitness goals because they lack personalized guidance, and accountability, and often do not know where to start. Even if people go to the gym, they feel overwhelmed by the abundance of options or lack proper mental motivation. There is no single solution that combines fitness training, personal growth, and mental health in one place.

## Resource management

Resource management is an essential part of the project. It serves as a toolkit that helps people achieve the project's goal.
Of the fitness personal training *primary* resources, we can outline

1. Knowledge/Expertise
2. Time
3. Money
4. Investors

### Reasoning

To explain the reasons behind the resources, we present the following table:

| *Knowledge/Expertise* | *Description* | *Appointment/Solution* | 
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Knowledge/Expertise   | Without the skills, knowledge and expertise, it is impossible to build any profitable project. We need people's expertise in specific fields to complete the project and deliver the product to the market. In other words: We need *Specialists*. | S1 |  
| Time                  | The main resource is the time (days), for every part of the project, according to the schedule, the specific amount of time is allocated | S2 |
| Money                 | Money is another primary resource, as we can barely afford to complete the project without funds. | S3 |
| Investors             | Stakeholders are important people to the project. Not only do they provide marketing expertise, but they can also help to advertise and develop strategies to attract more investors and achieve the financial objective of the project, satisfying both demand and investors with earned money. | S4 | 

> Table 1.: Reasoning behind primary resources of the fitness training application project.

### S1: Hiring more specialists

Our current team consists of four people:


| *Team member (full name)* | *Role* | *Specialization* |

| Irina Bašurova            | Fitness Consultant | Certified personal trainer providing exercise plans, fitness tracking strategies, and insights into user needs for fitness programs. |
| Anastasiia Keller         | 	Marketing Strategist | Developing marketing strategies to promote the app, expertise in digital advertising, SEO, and social media campaigns. |
| Katsiaryna Petukhova      | Quality Assurance Engineer | Ensuring app functionality and reliability through rigorous testing. Specializes in automation testing (Selenium, Cypress) and manual testing to identify and resolve bugs, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Stakeholder analysis

### Definition & Introduction

A person who puts money into a project that will make them profit (Cambridge University Press, 2024, § Investor). 
In other words, an investor is a vital person to the business, as they help it to grow. A notable example is the Shark Tank show, where entrepreneurs pitch their products to investors to secure funding and scale their operations. 

> Common Pitfall: Not every business succeeds. Failures often stem from poor management and vague objectives. When a project lacks a well-defined goal at its inception, it risks failure (Sergei Ivanov, 2024, Risk Management, § Risk Management Matrix, Reasoning and Explanation, Project Planning).

### What investors do we need?

For our fitness personal training application, we require investors who specialize in fitness, personal growth, and health-focused industries. These investors will not only provide funding but also bring valuable insights and expertise to the table.

Our mission is to create a product that makes people's lives more efficient and fulfilling. Through this app, we aim to empower individuals to achieve:

Success: Helping users reach their fitness and personal growth goals.
Joy: Promoting mental well-being alongside physical health.
Diligence: Encouraging consistent habits and discipline.
Health: Improving overall physical and mental wellness.
Wealth: Providing value that translates into personal and financial gains.

> We need investors that specialize in fitness training and personal growth. We need them to invest in our application to
> make people's lives more efficient and happy. We do so by creating a product that helps people to become more successful,
> joyful, diligent, ***healthy*** and wealthy.

## Cost assessment - Budget

### Overview

Budgeting is a critical component of project planning. It outlines the expected costs and ensures resources are allocated effectively to achieve the project's goals. For our fitness personal training application, the budget focuses on two primary areas: **development and operational costs**.

### Estimated Costs

| *Category* | *Description* | *Estimated Cost (in dollars: $)* |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Development | Costs related to hiring developers, designers, and fitness consultants. | $15, 000 | 
| Infrastructure | Expenses for renting virtual servers to host the app and website. | $5, 000 / year |
| Marketing & Promotion | Advertising, social media campaigns, and other promotional activities. | $3, 000 |
| Licencing & tools | Subscriptions for development tools, software licenses, and app store fees. | $2,000 |
| Testing | Costs for quality assurance and beta testing (manual and automated testing). | $1,500 |
| Miscellaneous | Unplanned expenses, minor adjustments, or additional services. | $1,000 |
