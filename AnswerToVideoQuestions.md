Answer:

1. What skills are more important? 
2. Is there any difference between Project Management Skills and Project Leadership Skills?
3. Are these skills inherited as a talent, or can they be developed?

## Answers

### What are the skills?
The project manager's skills are

1. Prioritization
2. Delegation
3. Effective communication
4. Strong organizational skills
5. Negotiation skills

More skills:

1. Enabling decision making
2. Communicating and escalating
3. Flexibility


### Difference between PM and PL skills

Yes, there is a difference for sure:

> Project management is about proper management: it wants to define, and plan projects (as a temporary endeavour),
> Allocate the right amount of time, people, and money to achieve the objective
> of a project. So, you do not lead people but manage all the resources and people's time properly
> to ensure that the project has an increased probability of being successful in the long term, as it is not always
> that projects end up being successful or fail - there is always data and correct decisions (project management)
> to make the project end up successfully.

Success in project management does not just mean project completion - it also includes achieving defined deliverables that meet stakeholders' expectations.

The leader focuses on another approach. I will illustrate this way:

> Genghis Khan is a project leader (PL), while his generals are project managers (PMs).

That is, Genghis Khan achieved his goals using strategy, vision and experience to give his orders to his generals and make the right decisions.
What does it mean?

> Genghis Khan aimed to expand the Mongol empire and use his generals' expertise to assess how and under what conditions he could achieve his
> goal (with each task having its prerequisites). He knew about ***Risk Management*** and defined correct ***intentions/goals***.

We can even imagine how Genghis composed a training ground and let generals train his soldiers, trusting them, as they were trained by Genghis or
raised by him, which further shows how much generals trusted Genghis Khan and the Khan trusted them. 

> Notice: it is a high level of architecture: Generals had to check for weather, allocate the right amount of training, prepare for upcoming battles,
> feed soldiers well, and check for injuries. Genghis would never attack if he knew that soldiers were in bad shape.

#### Another example: Enigma code-breaking project at Bletchley Park

Project leader: Alan Turing
Project managers: Dilly Knox (Senior Cryptanalyst), Gordon Welchman (Key Contributor to Bombe Design), and others.

Based on academic evidence, Alan Turing did a great job in studying and ultimately breaking the enigma machine that let people win the war. 
During the project's planning and execution, Alan used his vision and strategy to achieve the goal. He was engaged with complex mathematical
problems and had to unravel unknown ciphering algorithms to decrypt German messages.

One of the key findings is that Alan Turing could design and create the copy of the enigma to study and potentially automatize the decoding process.

> Each message required hours to be decrypted, and given the known keys' (a special sequence of letters that allow for decoding) table, for a human
> it would take days.

Alan Turing was the leader of the project and invested much of his time resources and intelligence to break the enigma code and enlighten other people
who worked with him on cryptography. 

As for project managers, they were engaged with this project and organized (Dilly Knox) most of the work, while Turing was busy with computational and high-level strategy.
It is false to state that Turing did all the job, as it was truly cooperation, but Turing was a genius, without whom, the entire process could go another path. Other PMs helped
to distribute the workload to speed up the process and execute the project. It included using people's time properly and checking if they needed more resources (also: more examples or documentation) such as buying technical devices or borrowing books because not all scientists are all-knowing. The process was scheduled and organized. Turing had to check if his invention worked
and if complied with what it was commanded to be. 

### Talent or trained?

The short answer:

> One can develop and sharpen your skills throughout life. Consistency, discipline, commitment and sheer will help one to develop and sharpen any skills one ever wanted to have.

A key phrase:

> honed through intense training and experience.

Quick example: John Wick (from the John Wick movie) played by Keanu Reeves.

Why? Because John Wick trained very hard and always managed the risk. He had a very strong will and commitment
in order to complete the tasks that he wished to do. 

Issue: Not always applicable. One might be born in poverty, and given no resources, one may not end up being successful at all. Being born in the right place is never controlled.
Consistency is indeed key to one's success because it helps one hone skills.

> Talent would speed up things but never guarantee anything. There is always a probability of one failing. So, proper management is the key.

#### Less short answer

To be successful, one cooperates and makes the right decisions based on one's experience. One trains hard. and fully commits oneself to the activity: *becomes a project leader
of one's project*. It takes time, money, connections, support, sheer will and many other things. Life is too complex to say "consistency helps one".

The purpose of talent is to navigate one in life. However, one can develop as many skills as one can handle to hone or need to. Talent is not related to willingness or intention.
Talent only makes one learn and use certain information faster than others. 

Is that even true?

Currently, we lack evidence about the human brain. We studied the Mars surface much more than our home Earth or the brain itself. Hence, we cannot assertively say that talents help 
people to speed up their skill development or that humans may not be as smart as certain geniuses. It feels like one was not born for the activity. For example, one can compare oneself
to Einstein. Why they are different from the great scientists? - The thinking model, knowledge, background, resources, support, and commitment. Our brains deceive us throughout life, and
sometimes when it feels like we enjoy the process, it is not true. Therefore, "true commitment" becomes especially strong. A person invests their time and resources to solve a problem or a project.

Thus, the probability of failure always remains, and the success rate is not always 100%, but proper management helps to make sure that the probability of success is higher than that of failure.
And to do so, project leaders and managers work hard, regardless of them being talented - they fulfil the meaning of their life, and they commit themselves.
