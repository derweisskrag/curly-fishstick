## Homework description

Case Study
Sam Smith is a Project Manager in an international IT company. The company is 
developing dynamically, despite the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
After 2020, everyone has become accustomed to relying more and more on .

telecommunications and electronic means of communication. Therefore, Sam Smith
began increasingly to use such tools as Zoom, Skype, Ms Teams, Google Hangouts 
Meet, video calls, messengers, etc. to communicate with the companyâ€™s partners. 
Trusted partners easily switched to this format of communication (with the 
dominance of remote communication channels), but communications with new 
suppliers and clients have slowed down somewhat. Often, these communications 
lead nowhere. 
Task:
1. How to choose the right means of business communication in this situation? 
2. How can you increase the efficiency of remote business communication

## Implementation

### How do you choose the right tool? (The first question)

So, I can outline these 4 factors:

1. Audience analysis
2. Nature of communication
3. Accessibility and user experience
4. Data security

You need to ensure that all data is secured and reliable and that no one is eavesdropping on or using the data of teams you work with in violation of the law or the privacy policy. 
Sometimes, the project manager uses different tools because every tool is used for a very specific task:

- Zoom for long meetings and in-depth talking about how and why something is supposed to be done;
- Messengers: for making quick notifications and updates, or professional chatting (to discuss details, moods, feelings, etc);
- GitHub, MS Teams, Google Workplace, Asana: for collaboration and actual work.
- Company's application to notify and plan the work to be done (organization and planning, as well as documentation) - an Asana alternative or additional app.

Therefore, there is no one-fit-all solution. You always want to use a tool for a task. As such, using a physical phone is also quite plausible and a very effective
tool for contacting the team very quickly. Time is an important resource and the project manager must allocate and use all available resources properly. 

#### Answer

> So, my answer is that there is no one-fit-all method to use; hence, you use a toolkit where certain methods are present.


### How to increase efficiency?

Likewise, I outline several actions:

1. Build trust
2. Optimize communication practices
3. Enhance interaction
4. Provide training
5. Evaluate and adapt
6. Maintain professional etiquette

The first step is of great importance. You build trust, you build your wealth. Even if the tool that you use is modern, it does not guarantee that
the team members that you work with are obliged to adapt to it. Hence, to boost efficiency, you have to build trust and adopt the right tool which 
is done by making tutorials, writing documentation, recording videos; as well as, meetings with email summaries and action plans.

Another important step is to set agendas before meetings to ensure that participants are prepared; use the time and prepare schedules; keep track of all
work done so far, and summarize key points and next steps after each meeting to ensure clarity and accountability.

As for making meetings interactive and boosting productivity & efficiency, you can make Q/A polls and ask questions during meetings to ensure clarity (
sometimes you can create quizzes to ensure everyone is prepared for new tasks). Not only does it entertain teams, but it also trains them.

Lastly, you should collect feedback from stakeholders about their experiences with different tools and communication approaches. Regularly, update communication
practices and user preferences.
