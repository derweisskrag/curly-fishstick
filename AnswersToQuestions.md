## Homework description

Case Study
Sam Smith is a Project Manager in an international IT company. The company is 
developing dynamically, despite the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
After 2020, everyone has become accustomed to relying more and more on .

telecommunications and electronic means of communication. Therefore, Sam Smith
began increasingly to use such tools as Zoom, Skype, Ms Teams, Google Hangouts 
Meet, video calls, messengers, etc. to communicate with the companyâ€™s partners. 
Trusted partners easily switched to this format of communication (with the 
dominance of remote communication channels), but communications with new 
suppliers and clients have slowed down somewhat. Often, these communications 
lead nowhere. 
Task:
1. How to choose the right means of business communication in this situation? 
2. How can you increase the efficiency of remote business communication

## Implementation

### How do you choose the right tool? (The first question)

So, basically, I can outline these 4 factors:

1. Audience analysis
2. Nature of communication
3. Accessibility and user experience
4. Data security

You need to ensure that all data is secured and reliable and that no one is eavesdropping on or using the data of teams you work with in violation of the law or the privacy policy. 
Sometimes, the project manager uses different tools because every tool is used for a very specific task:

- Zoom for long meetings and in-depth talking about how and why something is supposed to be done;
- Messengers: for making quick notifications and updates, or professional chatting (to discuss details, moods, feelings, etc);
- GitHub, MS Teams, Google Workplace, Asana: for collaboration and actual work.
- Company's application to notify and plan the work to be done (organization and planning, as well as documentation).

Therefore, there is no one-fit-all solution. You always want to use a tool for a task.
